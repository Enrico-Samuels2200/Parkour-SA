                If you don't already know what parkour is, allow me to<br/>
                inform you. Parkour is a dicipline that allows yourself to move<br/>
                effectively from point A to point B. With this you will gain the<br/>
                knowledge and skill to over come many obstacles with ease. Is that wall<br/>
                blocking your path? Why not scale over it, instead of going around it.

            <h1>Why learn Parkour?</h1>
            <p>
                Parkour is a great sport to learn. It keeps the body and mind active and<br/>
                it's also fun. It can be applyed to real life situations. You might miss<br/>
                that 06:30am bus not anymore. You going to be late for work, because your taxi<br/>
                is stucked in traffic a few blocks from your workplace, think again. Parkour can<br/>
                be used in many situations. It could be use it to escape life threatning<br/> 
                situations. Which we hope no one will ever be in that situation.<br/>

<!-- <p>
    Why parkour you say. Parkour is similar to martial arts<br/>
    minus all the strict regulations. Parkour teaches you to be one with<br/>
    the flow, to keep on moving foward. Be aware there are lots of mistakes<br/>
    to be made. It's just par of being human. Parkour is a sport many learn<br/>
    from trial and error, <br/>
